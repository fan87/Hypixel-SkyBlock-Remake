# End Of Project
It's been a long while since I started the Hypixel SkyBlock Remake project, but it's the end of this project.

Not going to say much, but the main reason is that Hypixel SkyBlock has changed too much, I don't enjoy it anymore, and my life has changed too much and I kinda can't handle it, I really need a rest.

Right now my life is just a mess, it's completely different from what it is when I started this project, I have no clue what's actually happening, so I have to deal with this first.

Ok let's just say my life goes fine, another problem is that I don't enjoy Hypixel SkyBlock anymore, it has changed too much, and all of those old SkyBlock memories cannot be found anymore. It's just impossible for me to get back on this project, at least in 2022.


## Development

This project requires a lot of work, contributions are very welcome.

### Gradle
We are using Gradle for this project
(See [About Kotlin and Gradle - Why we use them](#about-kotlin-and-gradle---why-we-use-them)). It's recommend to use
Gradle Wrapper. If you would like to use Gradle on your local machine.

It may take a while for the initial set up, not only because it's downloading Gradle Wrapper, but it's also downloading
BuildTools, and building a Spigot `server.jar`, and using it as dependency and `server.jar` to launch the server.

> ℹ If it freezes at `:plugin`, it's completely normal. As I said: it's building Spigot as dependency. If you want to
> see what it's doing right now, you can add `--info` argument to gradle, and it will print out more information
> about what it's doing right now.

### Developing
#### Test Running
> ℹ There's a ~0.5s input latency, but let's not worry about that. Don't worry! It doesn't affect the performance of
> the test server

Since we are using Gradle, we've set up a task that runs the server, and set everything up automatically.

To run the task, you can run test server with this command:

Unix-like operating system:
```sh
chmod +x gradlew # It's not executable by default. You only have to run it for the first time
./gradlew runServer --console=plain
```
Windows:
```batch
gradlew.bat runServer --console=plain
```

> ℹ `--console=pain` removes that fancy but annoying progress bar. You don't need it for test running


If you want to reload the plugin, you can run this following task:

Unix-like operating system:
```sh
chmod +x gradlew # It's not executable by default. You only have to run it for the first time
./gradlew reloadPlugin
```
Windows:
```batch
gradlew.bat reloadPlugin
```

#### Building
You can build the plugin with this command:

Unix-like operating system:
```sh
chmod +x gradlew # It's not executable by default. You only have to run it for the first time
./gradlew build
```
Windows:
```batch
gradlew.bat build
```

### File Structure
[//]: # (Using `sh` for comments syntax highlight)

```sh
# File structure

.idea/ # Run configurations etc.
gradle/ # A directory for gradle wrapper
run/ # Where server runs. File structure inside run/ may change anytime
readme-assets/ # Assets for this file. For example: Banner
BuildTools/ # Where Spigot BuildTools runs. Publishing server.jar directly is against EULA 

buildSrc/ # See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#sec:build_sources

plugin/ # Main Plugin

build.gradle.kts # Gradle build script. Using Kotlin DSL
gradlew # Gradle wrapper file for Unix-like operating systems
gradlew.bat # Gradle wrapper file for Windows
LICENSE # License information
readme.raw.md # Original readme file
readme.md # The file you are reading right now. (Generated by `generateReadMe` task)

### About Kotlin and Gradle - Why we use them

If you are not fine with Gradle and Kotlin, then first, let's talk about them.

If you don't know Gradle already, it's a build script based build tool. Maven is also a build tool, but the difference
is that Maven uses a definition file, but gradle uses a programming language for it. So unlike maven, you can basically
do anything you want during build without having a plugin. It's also faster than Maven, and as fast as IntelliJ's
artifact build.

Since this project is going to be really complicated, and spending time on the build tool is worth doing, I'll be using
Gradle for this project. Now, let's talk about the language we use: Kotlin.

Still, using Kotlin to code large scaled project like this (especially Spigot plugins) is better than doing it in Java.
There are some features like Delegation, Operator Overloading, Extension Function that we don't have in Java. Having
them will make the code way cleaner, and makes your life easier. I mean, yes, of course you can do them in Java by doing
some workaround, but it makes the code very messy.

Some example:
```kt
class SBPlayer(val originalPlayer: Player): Player by player {
    
    fun someMagicFunction() {
        this.sendMessage("Hello, World!") // SBPlayer is basically implementing Player class, but actually proxied
        // method calls to the `originalPlayer` variable
    }
    
}
```
> Delegation allows you to have stuff like this. I mean this is probably not what it was made for, but using it makes
> your life way easier.

I hope you now get why we use Gradle and Kotlin now: It makes our life easier, and makes the code cleaner (if you
understand Kotlin).
